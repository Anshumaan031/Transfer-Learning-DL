# Transfer-Learning-DL
The reuse of a pre-trained model on a new problem is known as transfer learning in machine learning. A machine uses the knowledge learned from a prior assignment to increase prediction about a new task in transfer learning. You could, for example, use the information gained during training to distinguish beverages when training a classifier to predict whether an image contains cuisine.</br >

The knowledge of an already trained machine learning model is transferred to a different but closely linked problem throughout transfer learning. For example, if you trained a simple classifier to predict whether an image contains a backpack, you could use the modelâ€™s training knowledge to identify other objects such as sunglasses.</br >

In computer vision, neural networks typically aim to detect edges in the first layer, forms in the middle layer, and task-specific features in the latter layers. The early and central layers are employed in transfer learning, and the latter layers are only retrained. It makes use of the labelled data from the task it was trained on.
